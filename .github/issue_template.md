Describe your issue/feature request here (you can remove all this text). 
Make sure to skim through the existing issues, your issue/request/etc may have already been noted!

Also: we're very aware of problems with the search. That is, all problems or errors regarding search results (eg. no wildcards, 720 not giving results for 720p, no negations with "-" and so forth) are known and issues regarding them will be moot as we're rewriting search to use another engine altogether. We know! We know!
If you believe you have something new to add, try to find an existing search-related issue and comment upon it instead!
