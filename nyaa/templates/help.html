<h1>Using the Site</h1>

{{ linkable_header("Torrent Colors", "torrent-colors") }}
<div>
	<span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">Green</span> entries (trusted) are:
	<ul>
		<li>Torrents uploaded by trusted users.</li>
	</ul>
	<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">Red</span> entries (remake) are torrents that match any of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Reencodes of original releases.</li>
		<li>Remuxes of another uploader's original releases that are hardsubbed and/or fixed</li>
		<li>Reuploads of original releases using non-original file names.</li>
		<li>Reuploads of original releases with missing and/or unrelated additional files.</li>
	</ul>
	<span style="color:orange; font-weight: bold;">Orange</span> entries are:

{{ linkable_header("Using the Search Engine", "using-search") }}
<div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Filtering</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Search results can be filtered by category and whether they are remakes or provided by a trusted uploader using the drop down menus next to the search bar</li>
	  <li>Results can be further sorted by size, date, seeders, number of completed downloads, and number of comments</li>
	</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Search Operators</span>
	<ul>
		<li>You can combine search terms with the <kbd>|</kbd> operator, to match any of the terms instead of all of them</li>
		<li>To exclude results with a certain keyword, prefix it with <kbd>-</kbd></li>
			<ul>
				<li>For example, searching for <kbd>foo -bar</kbd> will display results which contain <i>foo</i>, but not  <i>bar</i></li>
			</ul>
		<li>To search for a multi-word term, surround all the words with <kbd>""</kbd>(double quotes)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Searching for <kbd>"foo bar"</kbd> would return results containing exactly <i>foo bar</i></li>
				<li>You may also use <kbd>|</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> to manipulate phrases as if they were single keywords</li>
			</ul>
		<li>You can also specify precedence by using parentheses, but using phrases inside them might lead to unexpected results.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

	<h1>Help</h1>
	<p><b>The search engine</b> is located at the top right, and it allows users to search through the torrent titles available on the site. Results matching either word A or B can be included by typing a vertical bar between them (|). Results matching a certain word can be excluded by prefixing that word with a hyphen-minus (-). Phrases can be matched by surrounding them with double-quotes (). Search results can be filtered by category, remake, trusted, and/or A+ status, and then narrowed down further by age and size ranges as well as excluding specific users. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order by date, amount of seeders/leechers/downloads, size, or name. The search engine adapts to the current view and makes it possible to search for specific torrents in a specific subcategory from a specific user.</p>
	<p><b>Blue entries:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Torrents marked as A+ quality are blue in the torrent lists.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>These are exclusive torrents picked by us.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>They represent the best available version of this content.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>There will be no duplicates.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Only versions that we actually consider worthy of a seal of approval will be listed.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Uploaders are encouraged to leave a complete description of the release on the torrent information page. This is especially true for batches.<br></p>
	<p><b>Green entries:</b> Torrents uploaded by trusted users are green in the torrent lists.<br></p>
	<p><b>Orange entries:</b> Torrents must be marked as remakes if any of the following applies to the release:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Reencode of original release.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Remux of another uploader's original release for hardsubbing and/or fixing purposes.</p>
		</li><!--<li>Non-v2 (or non-v3, etc.) remux of original release using a similar source.</li>-->
		<li>
			<p>Reupload of original release using non-original file names.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Reupload of original release with missing and/or unrelated additional files.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Red entries:</b> Torrents containing completed series or other complete sets are red.<br></p>
	<p><b>Grey entries:</b> Hidden torrents are grey.<br></p>
	<p><b>The tools to manage your torrents</b> are located right above the torrent's details on the information page. Editable fields are the torrent's title, category, description, information link, metadata, and the alias and key fields which are explained on the page. It is also possible to hide the torrent which prevents it from being displayed in lists or even delete it altogether.<br></p>
	<p><b>Pseudo-anonymous uploads</b> are torrents that will appear to be anonymous, but you can still manage them through your account.<br></p>
	<p><b>Flagging torrents</b> points them out for moderator review. Torrents can be flagged by clicking on the link located in the upper right corner of their information pages.<br></p>
	<p><b>RSS</b> is a useful Web feed that automatically updates when a torrent is added by a user. Many programs such as popular BitTorrent clients, which can be set up for automatic downloading, can make use of RSS feeds. The RSS feed link is dynamic which means that it will - like the search function - adapt to the current view, search results included.<br></p>
	<p><b>BBCode user input</b> is parsed by the torrent descriptions, information links, and torrent comments, and they all support basic BBCode like [b], [i], [s], [u], [left], [center], [right], [code], [email], [img], [url], [color], [font], [size], [quote], and [spoiler].<br></p>
	<p><b>The upload page</b> returns various HTTP status codes in order to simplify automated uploads. The following details the custom codes used:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>200: The ID of the uploaded torrent can be found in the Record-ID header.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>418: You're doing it wrong.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>460: You forgot to include a valid announce URL. Torrents using only DHT are not allowed, because this is most often just a mistake on behalf of the uploader.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>461: This torrent already exists in the database.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>462: The file you uploaded or linked to does not seem to be a torrent.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>463: The form is missing required data like the category and/or the checkbox which confirms that you have read the rules.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>520: Server-side error. Wait for a few minutes, and then notify Nyaa if the problem did not go away.</p>
		</li>
