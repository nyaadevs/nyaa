	<p><a href="//{{ config.EXTERNAL_URLS['fap'] }}"><b>{{ config.EXTERNAL_URLS['fap'] }}</b></a> is the place for <b>non-work-safe</b> content only. Still, the following rules apply:</p>
	<ul>

			<p>Troll torrents are not allowed. These will be removed on sight.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>DVD source video is limited to 1024x576p.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Web source video is limited to 1920x1080p or source resolution, whichever is lower.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>TV source video is by default limited to 1920x1080p.<!-- The BS11, BS-NTV, NHK-BS Premium, and WOWOW channels are limited to 1920x1080p.--> SD channels, however, are limited to 480p.</p>

	<p>Naturally, untouched sources are not bound by these limits.</p><br>
	<p><b>Finally, a few notes concerning tagging and using other people's work:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Do not add your own tag(s) when reuploading an original release.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Unless you are reuploading an original release, you should either avoid using tags that are not your own or make it extremely clear to everyone that you are the one responsible for the upload.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>If these policies are not obeyed, then those torrents will be removed if reported by a group or person commonly seen as the owner of the tag(s). This especially applies to remake torrents.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Although only hinted at above, we will of course remove any troll torrents tagged with A-sucks, B-is-slow, or such if reported by A or B.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Remakes which are utterly bit rate-starved are not allowed.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Remakes which add watermarks or such are not allowed.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Remakes which reencode video to XviD or worse are not allowed.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Remakes of JPG/PNG-based releases are not allowed without exceptions since there is most often no point in making such.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
