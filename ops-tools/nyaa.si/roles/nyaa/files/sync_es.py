"""
stream changes in mysql (on the torrents and statistics table) into
elasticsearch as they happen on the binlog. This keeps elasticsearch in sync
with whatever you do to the database, including stuff like admin queries. Also,
because mysql keeps the binlog around for N days before deleting old stuff, you
can survive a hiccup of elasticsearch or this script dying and pick up where
you left off.

For that "picking up" part, this script depends on one piece of external state:
its last known binlog filename and position. This is saved off as a JSON file
to a configurable location on the filesystem periodically. If the file is not
present then you can initialize it with the values from `SHOW MASTER STATUS`
from the mysql repl, which will start the sync from current state.

In the case of catastrophic elasticsearch meltdown where you need to
reconstruct the index, you'll want to be a bit careful with coordinating
sync_es and import_to_es scripts. If you run import_to_es first than run
sync_es against SHOW MASTER STATUS, anything that changed the database between
when import_to_es and sync_es will be lost. Instead, you can run SHOW MASTER
STATUS _before_ you run import_to_es. That way you'll definitely pick up any
changes that happen while the import_to_es script is dumping stuff from the
database into es, at the expense of redoing a (small) amount of indexing.

This uses multithreading so we don't have to block on socket io (both binlog
reading and es POSTing). asyncio soonâ„¢

This script will exit on any sort of exception, so you'll want to use your
supervisor's restart functionality, e.g. Restart=failure in systemd, or
the poor man's `while true; do sync_es.py; sleep 1; done` in tmux.
